**ggpage** is a package to create pagestyled visualizations of text based data. It uses ggplot2 and final returns are ggplot2 objects.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

In this new version I have worked to include a lot of use cases that wasn't available in the first version. These new elements are previewed in the vignette.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of **ggpage** from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("ggpage")
```

or you can install the developmental version of **ggpage** from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/ggpage")
```

Example
-------

The package includes The Tinder-box by H.C. Andersen for examples.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpage)

head(tinderbox, 10)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 2
#>    text                                                        book        
#>    <chr>                                                       <chr>       
#>  1 "A soldier came marching along the high road: \"Left, righ… The tinder-…

#>  3 and was now returning home. As he walked on, he met a very… The tinder-…
#>  4 witch in the road. Her under-lip hung quite down on her br… The tinder-…
#>  5 "and said, \"Good evening, soldier; you have a very fine s… The tinder-…
#>  6 knapsack, and you are a real soldier; so you shall have as… The tinder-…

#>  8 "\"Thank you, old witch,\" said the soldier."               The tinder-…
#>  9 "\"Do you see that large tree,\" said the witch, pointing … The tinder-…

```

The basic workflow with **ggpage** is using either

-   `ggpage_quick` for a quick one function call plot or,
-   combining `ggpage_build` and `ggpage_plot` to do analysis (NLP for example) before the final plot is produced.

For a simple demonstration we apply `ggpage_quick` to our `tinderbox` object. It is important that the data.frame that is used have the text in a column named "text".

``` r
ggpage_quick(tinderbox)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

``` r

# Also pipeable
# tinderbox %>% ggpage_quick()
```

The same result would be achieved by using

``` r
tinderbox %>% 
  ggpage_build() %>% 
  ggpage_plot()
```

But this approach allows us to introduce more code between `ggpage_build` and `ggpage_plot` giving us multiple more ways to enhance the plots

``` r
tinderbox %>%
  ggpage_build() %>%
  mutate(long_word = stringr::str_length(word) > 8) %>%
  ggpage_plot(aes(fill = long_word)) +
  labs(title = "Longer words throughout The Tinder-box") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey70", "blue"),
                    labels = c("8 or less", "9 or more"),
                    name = "Word length")
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

And it will work nicely with other tidyverse packages

``` r
library(ggpage)
library(purrr)
library(gganimate)
library(tidytext)
library(zoo)

prebuild <- tinderbox %>%
  ggpage_build() %>%
  left_join(get_sentiments("afinn"), by = "word") 

midbuild <- map_df(.x = 0:50 * 10 + 1,
                   ~ prebuild %>% 
                    mutate(score = ifelse(is.na(score), 0, score), 
                           score_smooth = zoo::rollmean(score, .x, 0),
                           score_smooth = score_smooth / max(score_smooth),
                           rolls = .x))

midbuild %>%
  ggpage_plot(aes(fill = score_smooth)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "blue", mid = "grey", midpoint = 0) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  labs(title = "Smoothed sentiment of The Tinder-box, rolling average of {round(frame_time)}") +
  transition_time(rolls)
```

![](man/figures/README-readmegif-1.gif)

``` r
library(paletteer)
sentiment_types <- sentiments %>%
  filter(lexicon == "nrc") %>%
  pull(sentiment) %>%
  unique()

prebuild <- imap_dfr(sentiment_types,
  ~ ggpage_build(tinderbox) %>%
  left_join(filter(get_sentiments("nrc"), sentiment == .x), by = "word") %>%
    mutate(sentiment_state = .x,
           score = as.numeric(!is.na(sentiment)),
           score_smooth = zoo::rollmean(score, 5, 0)))

prebuild %>% 
  ggpage_plot(aes(fill = score_smooth), page.number = "top-left") +
  paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_c(viridis, cividis, direction = -1) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  transition_states(
    sentiment_state,
    transition_length = 10,
    state_length = 3
    ) +
  labs(title = "Sections with a sentiment of {closest_state}\nIn H.C. Andersen's Tinderbox")
```
