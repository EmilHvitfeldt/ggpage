**ggpage** is a package to create pagestyled visualizations of text based data. It uses ggplot2 and final returns are ggplot2 objects.

## Version 0.2.0

In this new version I have worked to include a lot of use cases that wasn't available in the first version. These new elements are previewed in the vignette.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **ggpage** from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggpage")
```

or you can install the developmental version of **ggpage** from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/ggpage")
```

## Example

The package includes The Tinder-box by H.C. Andersen for examples.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpage)

head(tinderbox, 10)
```

The basic workflow with **ggpage** is using either 

- `ggpage_quick` for a quick one function call plot or,
- combining `ggpage_build` and `ggpage_plot` to do analysis (NLP for example) before the final plot is produced.

For a simple demonstration we apply `ggpage_quick` to our `tinderbox` object. It is important that the data.frame that is used have the text in a column named "text".

```{r}
ggpage_quick(tinderbox)

# Also pipeable
# tinderbox %>% ggpage_quick()
```

The same result would be achieved by using

```{r eval=FALSE}
tinderbox %>% 
  ggpage_build() %>% 
  ggpage_plot()
```

But this approach allows us to introduce more code between `ggpage_build` and `ggpage_plot` giving us multiple more ways to enhance the plots

```{r}
tinderbox %>%
  ggpage_build() %>%
  mutate(long_word = stringr::str_length(word) > 8) %>%
  ggpage_plot(aes(fill = long_word)) +
  labs(title = "Longer words throughout The Tinder-box") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey70", "blue"),
                    labels = c("8 or less", "9 or more"),
                    name = "Word length")
```
